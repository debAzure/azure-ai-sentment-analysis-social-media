Sentiment Analysis Using Azure Cognitive Services (Text Analytics API)

Once reviews are stored in Azure Blob Storage, the next step is to perform sentiment analysis using Azure Cognitive Services, specifically the Text Analytics API. This API uses pre-built models to analyze and assess the sentiment in text data.

A. Setting Up Azure Cognitive Services (Text Analytics API)
1. Create a Cognitive Services Resource: In the Azure portal, create a new Cognitive Services resource and choose the Text Analytics API option.
2. Obtain API Key and Endpoint: After setting up the resource, obtain the API Key and Endpoint URL, which will be used to authenticate your API requests.

B. Text Analytics API Features
The Text Analytics API provides three primary features:
- Sentiment Analysis: It categorizes text as Positive, Neutral, or Negative and assigns a sentiment score.
- Entity Recognition: It identifies named entities such as organizations, people, or locations.
- Language Detection: It detects the language of the provided text.

For this project, we will focus primarily on Sentiment Analysis, which will be used to evaluate the sentiment of customer reviews.

C. Performing Sentiment Analysis with Python
A Python script will be developed to automate the following tasks:
1. Fetch Reviews: Retrieve the most recent reviews stored in Azure Blob Storage.
2. Send to Text Analytics API: Send the reviews to the Text Analytics API for sentiment evaluation.
3. Store Results: Save the sentiment analysis results (classified as Positive, Neutral, or Negative) in another Blob Storage container (e.g., `processed-reviews`).
4. Rate Limitation Handling: To comply with API rate limits, the script will process the last 10 reviews and wait for 10 seconds before processing the next set of reviews.

This automated process ensures continuous sentiment analysis of incoming reviews, with results stored in Blob Storage for further analysis and reporting.
